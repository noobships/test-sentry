# Contributing to TestSentry

Thanks for your interest in TestSentry! I'm a solo developer building this cross-device testing tool, and I'd genuinely love some help.

## 🎯 What I'm Building

TestSentry aims to solve the frustrating problem of manual responsive testing. Right now it's basic, but I have big plans for AI-powered automation and background testing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- Some React/TypeScript knowledge (beginner-friendly!)

### Setup
```bash
# Fork the repo and clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/test-sentry.git
cd test-sentry

# Install and run
npm install
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000 and test it out!
```

## 🤝 How You Can Help

Since I'm solo, **any help is appreciated** - no contribution is too small!

### 🐛 Found a Bug?
Just [open an issue](https://github.com/noobships/test-sentry/issues/new) with:

No need for formal templates - just tell me what broke!

### 💡 Have an idea?
I'm very open to suggestions! [Create an issue](https://github.com/noobships/test-sentry/issues/new) and let's discuss it.

### 🔧 Want to Code?

## 🛠 Development Workflow

Keep it simple:

1. **Fork the repo**
2. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b fix/your-feature`
3. **Make changes**
4. **Test locally**: Make sure `npm run dev` still works
5. **Commit**: Use clear commit messages
6. **Push and create PR**

### Code Style
- **Prettier** handles formatting (already set up)
- **ESLint** catches issues (runs on commit)
- **TypeScript** for safety
- Don't worry too much - I'll help with any style issues in review!
