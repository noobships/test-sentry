# Contributing to TestSentry

Thanks for your interest in TestSentry! I'm a solo developer building this cross-device testing tool, and I'd genuinely love some help.

## ▪️ What I'm Building

TestSentry aims to solve the frustrating problem of manual responsive testing. Right now it's basic, but I have big plans for AI-powered automation and background testing.

## ▪️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and pnpm 10.15.0+
- Git
- Some React/TypeScript knowledge (beginner-friendly!)

### Setup

```bash
# Fork the repo and clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/test-sentry.git
cd test-sentry

# Install and run
pnpm install
pnpm dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000 and test it out!
```

## ▪️ How You Can Help

Since I'm solo, **any help is appreciated** - no contribution is too small!

### Found a Bug?

Just [open an issue](https://github.com/noobships/test-sentry/issues/new) with:

- What you were doing
- What went wrong
- Screenshots if helpful

No need for formal templates - just tell me what broke!

### Have an idea?

I'm very open to suggestions! [Create an issue](https://github.com/noobships/test-sentry/issues/new) and let's discuss it.

### Want to Code?

**Perfect!** Here's what would help most right now:

## ▪️ Development Workflow

Keep it simple:

| **Step** | **Action**                                              |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `1.`     | **Fork the repo**                                       |
| `2.`     | **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b fix/your-feature` |
| `3.`     | **Make changes**                                        |
| `4.`     | **Test locally**: Make sure `pnpm dev` still works      |
| `5.`     | **Commit**: Use clear commit messages                   |
| `6.`     | **Push and create PR**                                  |

### Code Style

- **Prettier** handles formatting (already set up)
- **ESLint** catches issues (runs on commit)
- **TypeScript** for safety
- Don't worry too much - I'll help with any style issues in review!
